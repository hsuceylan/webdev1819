        <h1 class="one"><strong>BASEBALL</strong></h1>
        <h3 class="two"><strong>Baseball Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between 
        two teams of nine players each who take turns batting and 
        fielding.</strong></h3>
        <br>
        <div class="three">
            The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a
            ball (that is thrown by the opposing team's pitcher)
            with a bat swung by the batter, and then running c
            ounter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, 
            second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a 
            player advances around the bases and touches home plate. 
            Players on the batting team take turns hitting against 
            the pitcher of the fielding team, which tries to prevent
            runs by getting hitters out in any of several ways.
            A player on the batting team who reaches a base safely 
            can later attempt to advance to subsequent bases during 
            teammates' turns batting, such as on a hit or by other 
            means. The teams switch between batting and fielding
            whenever the fielding team records three outs. 
        </div>
        <br>
        <section>
            <h5 class="four">One turn batting for both teams, beginning with the 
            visiting team, constitutes an inning. A game is composed 
            of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of
            runs at the end of the game wins. If scores are tied at
            the end of nine innings, extra innings are usually 
            played. Baseball has no game clock, although most 
            games end in the ninth inning. </h5>
