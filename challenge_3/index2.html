    <h4 class="subheading">ABOUT ME</h4>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Hazal Ceylan, and I'm 15 years old. I would like to tell you about my education life so far and my accomplishments.
    I'm currently a student in Lane Tech College Prep High School in Chicago. I attended Norman A. Bridge Elementary School since kindergarten, and 
    I graduated from 8th grade in June 2017. I was a honor roll student throughout middle school, and 
    I was also a honor student in my graduation. I was accepted into Lane Tech, a selective enrollment high school. 
    During 6th grade, my friends and I entered a competition, called "The Future City Competition", which was a STEM based event. 
    We competed with 36 other teams, and after presenting to several judges, my friends and I were in the top five teams. After that, we presented to different judges, and won 5th place. Our project 
    also received the "Best Design" and "Best Use of Water Sources" award.
    During 7th and 8th grade, I entered my school's science fair, receiving an "Excellence" award in 7th grade and a "Honorable Mention" in 8th grade. In 8th grade, I also was qualified for a spelling bee
    tournament in my school. In Lane Tech, I am an Alpha student, meaning my classes are mostly based upon science and math. I also was a member of Student Council in my middle school, and I'm also 
    a member of Student Council in Lane Tech. I can speak three languages, including English, French, and Turkish. 
    I enjoy learning about history and science, especially astronomy."</p>

    <h4 class="subheading">TALENTS & HOBBIES</h4>
    <p>Let me tell you about my talents and hobbies. I enjoy playing sports with my frineds, and I play various types of sports, including volleyball and archery. I was on my middle school's volleyball team in 5th and 6th grade; I started archery the summer of 8th grade. 
I also run, as a hobby, during the fall in a park near my house, and my sister and I ride our bikes in the park during our free time. We enjoy having the wind race across our faces.
Subjects that I enjoy to learn about are history and science, especially astronomy. I have a telescope that enables me to gaze at the sky at night. 
As I mentioned before, I also speak three languages: English, French and Turkish. I am fluent in all of these languages. 
I also play the piano; I started taking piano lessons from a french music professor when I was 11 years old.
That year, I had my first concert. and I had a total of 5 concerts. I enjoy reading books, my favorite genres being adventure and historical/realistic fiction. 
I can draw well too, and enjoy drawing during my vacation breaks. I love traveling, and have traveled to various places, and plan on doing more traveling in the future. 
I also am skilled in photography, and enjoy taking pictures of landscapes that I visit. My sister and I like to watch movies together over the weekends. 
But, most of all, I enjoy being with my family; they can make me laugh when no one else can!</p>
